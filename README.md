### Federico Taschin
My main interest is Reinforcement Learning, with particular focus on Distributional RL, Goal-Conditioned RL, and Hierarchical RL. My goal is to become a researcher in the field, and I am currently looking for PhD opportunities. My life in brief:

- 2019 - Today: **Machine Learning** Master student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). Research-oriented Master program where I first met and fell in love with Reinforcement Learning. Particular focus of the program is on Deep Learning, and I developed several implementations of deep architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and [HGNs](https://github.com/CampusAI/Hamiltonian-Generative-Networks)), as well as Deep RL algorithms like [ACER](https://github.com/fedetask/ACER-torch).
- 2019 - Today: **Driverless Engineer** at [KTH Formula Student](https://www.kthformulastudent.se/). The goal of KTH Formula Student is to develop an autonomous electric racing car. I joined at the beginning of my Master studies in the SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) subgroup. After an initial study of SLAM algorithms, my first contribution was a core implementation of [GraphSLAM](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/thrun.graphslam.pdf). Having gained a good knowledge of the SLAM software and of the overall driverless system, I had a substantial part in the recruiting process of new members for the driverless team in early 2020, interviewing > 15 candidates with responsibilities in the decisional process, and oversighted the integration of new members in the SLAM group. From February 2020 to February 2021 I covered the role of **Technical Integrator** of the Driverless team, supervising integration of software modules developed by subgroups in the racing car.  Currently, I am working on improving the legacy implementation of [FastSLAM](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/Montemerlo03a.pdf), and I developed a Python library to compute evaluation metrics of the SLAM performances in order to track the level of improvement of new features.
- 2018 - 2019: **Embedded Software Developer Intern** at [Profitap](https://www.profitap.com/)
- 2015 - 2018: Bachelor Degree in **Computer Engineering** at [Universit√† degli Studi di Padova](https://www.unipd.it/)
